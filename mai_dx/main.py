MAI Diagnostic Orchestrator (MAI-DxO)

This script provides a complete implementation of the "Sequential Diagnosis with Language Models"
paper, using the `swarms` framework. It simulates a virtual panel of physician-agents to perform
iterative medical diagnosis with cost-effectiveness optimization.

Based on the paper: "Sequential Diagnosis with Language Models"
(arXiv:2506.22405v1) by Nori et al.

Key Features:
- Virtual physician panel with specialized roles (Hypothesis, Test-Chooser, Challenger, Stewardship, Checklist)
- Multiple operational modes (instant, question_only, budgeted, no_budget, ensemble)
- Comprehensive cost tracking and budget management
- Clinical accuracy evaluation with 5-point Likert scale
- Gatekeeper system for realistic clinical information disclosure
- Ensemble methods for improved diagnostic accuracy

Example Usage:
    # Standard MAI-DxO usage
    orchestrator = MaiDxOrchestrator(model_name="gpt-4o")
    result = orchestrator.run(initial_case_info, full_case_details, ground_truth)

    # Budget-constrained variant
    budgeted_orchestrator = MaiDxOrchestrator.create_variant("budgeted", budget=5000)

    # Ensemble approach
    ensemble_result = orchestrator.run_ensemble(initial_case_info, full_case_details, ground_truth)

            CORE RESPONSIBILITIES:
            - Maintain a probability-ranked differential diagnosis with the top 3 most likely conditions
            - Update probabilities using Bayesian reasoning after each new finding
            - Consider both common and rare diseases appropriate to the clinical context
            - Explicitly track how new evidence changes your diagnostic thinking

            APPROACH:
            1. Start with the most likely diagnoses based on presenting symptoms
            2. For each new piece of evidence, consider:
               - How it supports or refutes each hypothesis
               - Whether it suggests new diagnoses to consider
               - How it changes the relative probabilities
            3. Always explain your Bayesian reasoning clearly

            - Key evidence supporting each hypothesis

            - Optimize for information value, not just clinical reasonableness
            - Consider test characteristics: sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive values
            - Balance diagnostic yield with patient burden and resource utilization

            SELECTION CRITERIA:

            4. Sequential Logic: What should we establish first before ordering more complex tests?

            APPROACH:
            - For each proposed test, explicitly state which hypotheses it will help confirm or exclude
            - Consider both positive and negative results and their implications

            2. Assess etiology/causative factors
            3. Evaluate anatomic specificity
            4. Consider diagnostic completeness
            5. Judge clinical management implications

            OUTPUT FORMAT:
            - Score (1-5) with clear label
            - Detailed justification referencing specific rubric criteria
            - Explanation of how diagnosis would affect clinical management
            - Note any acceptable medical synonyms or equivalent terminology

            Maintain high standards while recognizing legitimate diagnostic variability in medical practice.
